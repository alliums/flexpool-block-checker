# flexpool-block-checker
a small nodejs program which sends a Windows toast notifications to your desktop every time a new block is mined(not necessarily confirmed) by the Flexpool US pool.

you must have NodeJS installed. just clone this repo and use npm start.
fyi: in order to actually display the notifications, snoretoast has to stick a shortcut in your start menu.

woof woof.
